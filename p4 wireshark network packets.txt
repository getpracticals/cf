Wireshark is a Unix or Windows packet capture and analysis tool. Unlike tcpdump or tools such as RawCap, Wireshark is a GUI-based tool and has a number of not only packet capture, but also analysis features. As a result, Wireshark may be difficult to deploy rapidly during an incident as the program has to be installed
